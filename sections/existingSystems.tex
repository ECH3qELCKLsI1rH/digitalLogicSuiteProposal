\section{Existing Systems}
Several existing tools provide digital logic design, analysis, and simulation functionalities. Some notable systems include:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Logisim}: A user-friendly interface for building digital logic systems but lacks command-line capabilities.

    \item \textbf{Digital Works}: Supports circuit construction and basic simulation, but does not provide features for Boolean expression parsing or Karnaugh map minimization.

    \item \textbf{Logic Friday}: A Windows-based application for simplifying and analyzing Boolean equations, generating truth tables, and Karnaugh maps but, limited to a GUI environment.
\end{enumerate}

Despite the availability of these tools, there is a lack of a lightweight, extensible, command-line-based tool designed specifically for learning, experimenting with, and automating digital logic analysis. This gap inspired us for the development of \textbf{Digital Logic Suite} project.
