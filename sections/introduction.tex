\section{Introduction}

Digital logic design is fundamental to both electronics and computer engineering. \textbf{Digital Logic Suite} aims to provide a comprehensive, command-line-based toolkit for parsing and evaluating Boolean expressions, generating truth tables, minimizing logic using Karnaugh maps, simulating digital circuits, and visualizing logic structures.

The suite uses C++ object-oriented programming concepts and integrates with Graphviz for graphical representation.
