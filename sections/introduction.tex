\section{Introduction}
Digital logic design is fundamental to computer engineering and electronics. The Digital Logic Suite aims to provide a comprehensive, command-line-based toolkit for parsing and evaluating Boolean expressions, generating truth tables, minimizing logic using Karnaugh maps, simulating digital circuits, and visualizing logic structures. The suite uses C++ object-oriented programming concepts and integrates with Graphviz for graphical representation.
