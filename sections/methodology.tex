\section{Methodology}
The project will follow an iterative, modular development approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requirements analysis and system design.
    \item Implementation of core modules (expression parser, truth table generator).
    \item Integration of minimization and simulation features.
    \item Development of CLI and user documentation.
    \item Integration with Graphviz for visualization.
    \item Testing, debugging, and optimization.
\end{enumerate}
